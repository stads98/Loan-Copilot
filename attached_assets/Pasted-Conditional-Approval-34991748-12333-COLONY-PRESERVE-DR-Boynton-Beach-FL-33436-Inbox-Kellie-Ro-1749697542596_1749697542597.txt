Noah, here the ROV for rental reconsideration. I could only find one rental. I don't have access to MLS.

Please send to AMC and request reconsideration for higher market rents.

Btw, has there ever been an instance where the lowered value or market rent after making a ROV request?

Hi Mike and Noah,

Please send this revision request form to the appraiser for higher market rents. 

We really need to get a fair valuation. The market rents came back so low he's leasing it for about 6k which is accurate and the appraiser gave 4.7k market. - It's killing the DSCR here.

Please submit asap.

Thank you,
Dan
